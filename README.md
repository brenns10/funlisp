funlisp
=======

Another lisp implementation, this time aiming to be self-contained, portable,
well documented, and easy to embed and use.

This implementation is derived from [libstephen lisp][], which is in turn built
off the experience of an earlier [attempt][lisp v1].

To compile, a simple `make` should do. For debugging, you can use the
`make CFG=debug` configuration, which enables debugging symbols.
