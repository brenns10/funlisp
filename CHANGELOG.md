## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] (BETA) - 2018-06-13

Initial release! This is the first release with a source tarball and the
capability to be installed system-wide. It is a beta release, so the API is not
yet fully stable. Currently included in this release:
- Builtin functions, lambda functions, etc
- User context for runtime and builtin objects
- Full C89 compliance

See the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/brenns10/funlisp/issues) for
planned features, especially in the
